 * \brief This encapsulates settings which dictate the intended operation of
 * 	the firmware being built. This firmware is designed to have similar
 *	core code, but be able to have the Steam Controller act as a variety
 *	of different devices. These configurations need to be compile time as
 *	the different behaviors of the device are mutually exclusive.
